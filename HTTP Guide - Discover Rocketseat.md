- `HyperText Transfer Protocol` : 
	- rules to how we can transfer hyperTexts
	- allow us to exchange informations and data on the internet
	- exchange messages, where we can send/receive HTML, CSS, Scripts, Images and Videos...

- `Request`
	- `Methods`
		- define the type of our request
		- what action that *I WANT* to do in the server
		- eg:
			- `GET`: we will get a resource
			- `POST`: create a resource
	- `Headers`
	- `Body`: not obligatory 

- `Response` 
	- `Status code`
		- the response from the server about the status of the request
		- eg
			- `200`: the code that everything was OK
			- `301`: redirecting request 
			- `404`: page not found
			- `500`: internal server error
	- `Headers`
	- `Body` 
	
- `Headers`: 
		- informative fields
		- in the form of `key: value` 
		- eg
			- `Content-Type: application/json`
			- `User-Agent: Chrome`
			- `Request URL: www.google.com` 
	- `Body`: 
		- `HMTL`
		- `Content`
		- `JSON`

- `Resource` : 
	- the location where we send the request
	- we will use a URL 
		- eg:
			- `https://google.com`
			- `http:/localhost:3000/posts?q=oracle` 

- `curl` : to see the manual, just type `man curl` in the terminal
	- `curl <web site we want to look the response>`
	- `curl -i <web site we want to look the response>` : `-i` to see the headers
	- `curl -v <web site we want to look the response>` : to see ALL the headers

- `Concepts` 
	- simple and readable by anyone
	- based in the interaction between *client/server*, request/response
	- *stateless* : doesn't store state
		- don't store data
		- there's no relation between the connections
		- *sessions*: they exist in the browsers to store some information that we WANT to store as:
			- Cookies
			- Local storage, session storeage..
	- Extensible
		- by the utilization of the headers we can make many exchanges of data between the client and server, using *headers* 
		- *body* used to send more data in our *request* ou receive something in the *response*

- `Client` : 
	- it's the *User Agent* 
		- most of the times it's a *Browser*
		- also can be the *cURL* 
	- it's the entity that begins the communication 
	- `Requests` 
		- are done by *actions* done by the client
			- GET: request some data
			- POST: create some record
			- PUT: update some record
			- DELETE: delete a record

- `Server`: 
	- it's a machine somewhere in the world
	- listening to requestes to process
	- there's the possibility of one computer have many servers running 
	- *response* 
		- have *HEADERS* 
			- that containg *status code*, 404, 500
		- can have a *BODY* 

- `Proxies`: 
	- are things that stand between the *client* and *server*
	- help to exchange the data
	- eg
		- internet router
	- can have many functionalities
		- *cache* to answer something faster
		- *filter* like a antivirus or parental control
		- *load balancing* distribute the load in path that the data runs until it gets delivered to the client
		- *authentication*
		- *authorizations* 

- `URI`: 
	- *Uniform Resource Identifier* : 
		- identify a resource
		- by their *name* or *location*
		- eg
			- You are a *resource*
				- you have a name
				- you have an address

		- `resource`: 
			- it's the *target* for the request
			- if we can *identify, give a name, address or handle* it's a `resource` 
			- can be something identifiable or a entity
				- digital as a *email*
				- abstract as a *session* or a *authentication*
				- physical as a *product* or a *user in the system



		- `Locator`: 
			- we use the *URL*
				- that stands for *Uniform Resource Locator* 
				- every URL is a URI, but the inverse it's not always true
				- has 2 obligatory components and 5 optional
					- obligatories:
						- protocol (http, https, mailto, ftp)
						- domain (rocketseat.com.br)
					- optional: 
						- sub domain (www)
						- path (...the_webiste`/blog`) 
						- parameters (...the_website/watch`?v=aushdhaus`) 
						- port (...the_website`:8080`) 
							- without explicitly informing, when we use *http* it's port 80 and with *https* it's port 443
						- anchor (...the_website/index.html`#someplace`) 
							- it's how we can send the user to a specific place in the html of a page

		- `name`: 
			- *URN Uniform Resource Name* 
			- eg
				- `urn:isbn:0451450523` this would provide you with a book
			- the URN it's not very used in the web development

- `HTTP Messages` 
	- composed by `request` or `response` 
	- exists in two versions `HTTP/1.1` and `HTTP/2`
		- `HTTP/1.1` more ligible and using text
		- `HTTP/2` binary structure, better for optimizations but in the end it's the same as the 1.1 version

- `Methods`
	- Options
		- gives us informations about the disponibility of the methods of the request
		- `curl -X OPTIONS http://localhost:3000/posts -i` will return some data to us, and in that data one line outstands it self that it's the one showing the allowed methods
			- **Access-Control-Allow-Methods**: GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE
	- Get
		- to get a resource
		- only receives data
		- don't have *body* in **requests**, only in **responses** 
	- Head
		- it's similar to *GET* but we only receive in the response the *head*, nothing more
	- Post
		- publish or register a resource
		- create something
		- have *body* in the request and response. There's actually a chance that you only receive a *status 200* in the response
	- Put: 
		- create a new or update a resource
		- when creation
			- status code 201
		- when update
			- status code 204 or 200
		- have *body* in the request but not in the response 
	- Patch
		- partially change a resource, differs from *put* because *put* is used to change the whole resource
		- can have body in both *request/response*
	- Delete
		- to remove a resource
		- status code 
			- 202 *accepted*
			- 204 *no content*
			- 200 *ok* 
		- possible to have body in the *request/response* 
	- Headers
		- additional information that is used in the *request or response* 
		- `Name : value` 
		- we have three contexts for *headers* 
			- *General* 
			- *request headers*
			- *response headers*

- `Status code`
	- *1 0 0*
		- all right, continue
	- *2 0 0*
		- *200* : Ok (GET, POST)
		- *201* : Created (PUT)
		- *204*: No Content (DELETE, PUT)
	- *3 0 0*
		- *301* : moved permantly (usually GET)
		- *308*: permanent redirect (more to POST)
		- *302*: found (more for GET)
		- *307*: Temporary redirect (more for any but GET)
	- *4 0 0*
		- *400*: bad request
		- *401*: Unauthorized
		- *403*: Forbidden
		- *404*: not found
		- *405*: method not allowed
		- *429*: too many requests
	- *5 0 0*
		- *500*: internal server error
		- *503*: service unavaiable
