`Styled Components` 
- it's a way for us to style our applications in react using a concept known as *css in js* .
- *css in js* is basically us writting our css in the javascript syntax
- to begin using it, we need to install it
	- `npm i styled-components` 
	- since we're using typescript, we also need to install the types for the *styled components*. We're going to install this package only as a development dependency because in *production* our code is 100% compiled in JS
		- `npm i @types/styled-components` 
- So why we're going to use *Styled components* ?
	- we're going to use it to make it simpler to style our components using JS
	- when we need to apply many styles to a component or even give it a style that is conditioned to a variable, it's easier to us to apply this styling. When you think of one property that changes the styling it seems that all the trouble to use *styled components* isn't worth the work, but when we have more properties that can change styling it will make our job easier
	- one thing to notice is that always when we use *interpolation (${})* in a styled component, react will run it as a function and pass all the *props* that the styled component have in it so we can use these values
- Configuring themes
	- we can create a folder inside *src* with the name *styles/themes* and inside we create a file *default.ts* that will be the default theme for the application
	- to use we'll need to import the *ThemeProvider* from *styled-components* and wrap around the components that we want to apply our theme
	-  to access the colors that we declared in the *default.ts* file inside one of our *styled components* we can access it using *props.theme.* and the name of the property declared inside the file of the theme choosen at the moment 
- Types of Themes
	- when we use Typescript we have the possibility of defining our own themes in our project
	- we can name it *@types* but you can use whatever you think it's better
		- inside we will declare our files with the extension *.d.ts* this meaning that inside this file we're only going to have code defining types for typescript
		- and the *theme variable* that we had defined in the *default.ts* had some properties in herself, being *primary and secondary* both string. If we want to put this *typing* into a variable, we can use a function of typescript called *typeof*
			- we define a *type variable* and then use this function to assign the type 
				- `type ThemeType = typeof defaultTheme;` 
			- so we can use this typing in our project, we need to *declare* a module that we'll override something or we'll replace the typing, in our case as we will have imported the *styled-components* and we'll use the *declare module styled-components* we will only override a type that is the *DefaultTheme*
- Global styles
	-  inside the folder *styles* we'll create a file named *global.ts*
	- and inside we'll be importing a function from *styled-components* called *createGlobalStyle*
		- and inside we use the same syntax that we did for a styled-component `export const GlobalStyle = createGlobalStyle` and inside we put all the styling that we want to apply to every html component from our application
	- to apply this global style to our application, we can import it anywhere in our application but we'll put inside the *App.ts* and it's important that it stays inside the *ThemeProvider* so we still have access to the variables from the theme
